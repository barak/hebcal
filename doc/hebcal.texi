@cindex overview

The @code{hebcal} program produces a Jewish calendar in various
formats, but by default in a format suitable for input to @code{calendar}.

@code{hebcal} was written by Danny Sadinoff, with major contributions by 
Michael Radwin.  Hebcal is, at root, a port of the GNU Emacs Calendar lisp
code by Edward M. Reingold and Nachum Dershowitz.
